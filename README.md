Tinlion is a deep green, foliage-inspired dark theme for VS Code. It’s built around the colors I reach for most: spruce greens, mossy highlights, and soft teal accents. The goal is to feel like you’re working in a calm, shaded canopy rather than staring into a floodlight.

The screenshot in the `images` directory shows the theme in action: rich emerald backgrounds, bright but not harsh syntax colors, and UI chrome that stays out of the way so code and structure can stand out. If you like green-heavy palettes that still preserve contrast and readability, Tinlion is for you.
