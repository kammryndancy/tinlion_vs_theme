#### TinLion clean in green
Tinlion is a deep green, foliage-inspired dark theme for VS Code. It’s built around the colors I reach for most: spruce greens, mossy highlights, and soft teal accents. The goal is to feel like you’re working in a calm, shaded canopy rather than staring into a floodlight.
