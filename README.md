# Tinlion VS Code Theme

This is a minimal Visual Studio Code color theme extension skeleton.

## Using it in VS Code

1. Open this folder in VS Code: `tinlion_vs_theme`.
2. Run **Debug: Start Debugging** (or press F5) to launch a new Extension Development Host.
3. In the new window, open the Command Palette and run **Preferences: Color Theme**.
4. Choose **Tinlion** from the list.

You can now tweak `themes/tinlion-color-theme.json` and reload the Extension Development Host to iterate on the theme.
